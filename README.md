# :memo: App Description

:four_leaf_clover: :iphone: AgroConnect is an application that links farmers and consumers. Farmers can offer their goods for sale, and buyers can easily find the local farmer to purchase fresh agricultural produce.

The app gives users the choice to use our integrated AI model to identify plant illness and offer treatment recommendations when they have concerns about pests and diseases, yield, etc.
